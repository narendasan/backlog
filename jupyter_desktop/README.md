# Jupyter Desktop

Jupyter is a great way to work with python, julia or other scripting langauges and being able to inject
visualizations and documentation inline. 

A good workflow for deep learning is to use these notebooks to live monitor training and to distribute instructions. 
However there isnt a good editor on the desktop that doesn't polute the desktop enviornment.

## Goal 
To have a clean editor UI for Jupyter Notebooks that is backed by Nvidia Docker. 
Have some sort of interface to install packages.
